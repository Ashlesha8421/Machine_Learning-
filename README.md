## Supervised and unsupervised machine learning
| Supervised machine learning | Unsupervised machine learning |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| supervised machine learning algorithum are trained using label data | unsupervised machine learning alorithum are traind using unlabeled data |
| Model takes direct feedback to check whether it is predicting correct output or not | Model does not take any feedback |
| Model predicts the output | Model does not take any feedback |
| Input data provided to model along with output | Only input data is provide to the model |
| GOAL : To train model so that it can predict the output when it given new data | GOAL: To find the hidden pattern & useful insights from the unknown dataset |
| Need supervision to train the model | Does not need supervision to train model |
| Used for those cases where we know the input as well as corresponding output data | Used for those cases where we know the input data and no corresponding output data |
| Catogerical in regression and classification | Classification in clustering and association |
| Produce accurate result | Model may give less accurate result as compared to supervised learning |
| SL is not close to AI as in this case, we first train the model for each data & then only it can predict the correct output | More close to true AI as it learn similarity as a child learns daily routine things by his experinces |
| Include algorithum : Regression, Decision Tree , SVM, Multi-class Classification , K-Neighbour , Logistic Regression.,etc | Include algorithum : Clustering, KNN, Apriori Algorithum.,etc |

## Reniforcement Learning :
                         Reniforcement Learning is a feedback based learning method.
*  In which a Learning agents gets a reward for each right action and get penalty for each wrong action .
*  The agent learns automatically with these feedbacks and improves its performance. 
*  In reniforcement learning, the agent intracts with the enironment and explores it
*  The goal of an agent is to get the most reward points, and hence , it improves its performances
*  Example :The robotic dog, which automatically learns the movement of his arms.
